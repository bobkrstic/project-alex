             <h1>About the Mobile Kitchen</h1>

<p>After many years of planing and saving, Mobile Panini hit the road,
literally, with the purchase of a 2007 Chevy P90 that we rescued
from its moribund existence as a dirty diaper van. After a
thorough cleaning (trust us!) the van was retrofitted into a
    classic commercial kitchen with state-of-the art equipment.</p>

<p> The 22' kitchen allows us to accommodate all demands, ranging
from large corporate catering events to private dining parties.
    Just save us a parking space.</p>


       <h1> Welcome</h1>
             <img src="mp_photo1.png" alt="">
 
<p><strong>Mobile Panini</strong> is the culmination of the dream of Antonio and Carmen
Dolcini, who came to America looking to serve people the
authentic recipes learned from their Sicilian family.</p>

<p>Antonio began work as a child in his grandmother's deli where he
learned the age-old secrets of Sicilian cooking. He refined his
technique at the Culinary Institute of Milan. His younger brother,
Carmen, with no less of a love for cooking and good food, also
worked in the deli and became well-acquainted with the open-air
fresh food markets of his home town. Carmen too, is a proud
graduate of the Culinary Institute of Milan.</p>

<p>Now you can enjoy what they have learned and mastered, right outside 
your door; but with no compromises in freshness or delicacy of preparation.
We've partnered with <em>Curbside</em> Thai to bring you the finest cuisine on 
four wheels - from the East and the West!</p>
